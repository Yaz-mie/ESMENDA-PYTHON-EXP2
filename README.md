## üìå Description  

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates beginner applications of the **NumPy library** in Python.  
It shows how to create arrays, normalize data, perform mathematical transformations, and filter values.  

The problems solved include:  
1. **Array Normalization** ‚Äì Generate a 5√ó5 random array and normalize its values.  
2. **Integer Array Transformation** ‚Äì Create a 10√ó10 array of integers (1‚Äì100), compute squares, and extract divisible numbers.

3. Run each cell to see the outputs directly below.

## üí° Examples w/ Explanation

**01 üé≤ Random Array Normalization**

```python
#Import NumPy library
import numpy as np

# Create random 5x5 ndarray
X = np.random.rand(5, 5)
```
- import numpy as np, is needed for all numerical and array operations.
- X = np.random.rand(5, 5), generates a 5√ó5 array with random values between 0 and 1.
  

```python
# Normalize X
Xmean = X.mean() 
Xstd = X.std()
Xnormalized = (X - Xmean) / Xstd
```
- Computes the mean and standard deviation of the array.
- Applies normalization formula
- Ensures the data has mean = 0 and std = 1

```python
# Save the result of the normalized array
np.save('X_normalized.npy', Xnormalized)

# Print output
print(Xnormalized)
```
- np.save, saves the normalized array to a file for future use.
- print, displays the normalized 5√ó5 array.
